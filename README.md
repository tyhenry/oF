My project is titled "Header."  It's basically a game of (one-player) pong that uses the Haar finder from openCV to detect your head position.  Your head then becomes the paddle, and you can move the paddle left and right by moving your head right and left.
Sounds play when the ball hits the walls, your head or you miss.
